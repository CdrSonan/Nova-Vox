Nova-Vox is distributed under the GNU GPL 3.0 (or later) license, which you will be prompted to agree to shortly.
We believe that choosing this license is the best option for Nova-Vox because of its openness, and because it ensures Nova-Vox will remain free software that everyone can benefit from.
However, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following points, even though none of them constitute additional terms to the license used by Nova-Vox.

-Do not process recordings of other people without their consent

-Do not violate the licenses of Nova-Vox Voicebanks, Plugins or other content of the same nature.

-Do not port Voicebanks from other engines to Nova-Vox if doing so violates their respective licenses or Terms of Service

Our goal is not to make Nova-Vox less open in any way, but rather to work towards an environment in which all Nova-Vox users can safely use our software and related content, without worrying about their work potentially being abused in ways they did not agree to.
