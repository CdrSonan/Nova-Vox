# Nova-Vox
Main repository of the Nova-Vox vocal synthesizer project.

Branch structure:
Initial preliminary testing should occur on "personal" branches. These don't need to be pushed to GitHub if you don't want to.
When starting to work on the main project, there will be 4 branches created:
-development-frontend
-development-backend
-testing
-main
The two development branches will be used for day-to-day development by the respective teams. Once ready, these branches get merged into testing, which holds the version
passed to the beta testers. Bugfixes will be implemented via pull requests, then the branch will be merged into main, which holds the latest stable version.
More development branches may be added if required.
