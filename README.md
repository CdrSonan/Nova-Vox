# Nova-Vox
Main repository of the Nova-Vox vocal synthesizer project.

Branches will be created per feature. All finished ones are to be merged into a "testing" branch that allows team members to pull nightly builds.
After validation and, if necessary, fixes, this branch will be merged onto master and be released with the next update cycle.
