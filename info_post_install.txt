Thank you for installing Nova-Vox!

Upon its first launch, Nova-Vox is going to precompile its code, as well as the software libraries it depends on.
Therefore, it is normal for the first launch to take up to several minutes.
All further launches are going to be much faster.

To get started, we recommend you to check out our tutorial page (PLACEHOLDER FOR LINK).
You can also download additional Voices, Plugins and more from our website (PLACEHOLDER FOR LINK).

Have fun creating!
